.SH NAME
rerun \- Watches for changes to your source files and then executes a command.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Usage rerun DIRECTORY FILE_PATTERN COMMAND...
.PP
Watches DIRECTORY recursively for changes in any file that matches FILE_PATTERN
and then runs COMMAND. FILE_PATTERN should be in the glob format.
.PP
You probably want to wrap both the FILE_PATTERN and COMMAND in quotes,
so the shell doesn't pre\-expand patterns and the command is seen as a
single argument.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
rerun web/js "*.js" "juicer merge \fB\-min\fR '' web/js/behavior.js
.IP
rerun web "*.css" "bin/package_site.sh
.PP
rerun will ignore dotfiles such as .#foo.js. It will watch new subdirectories which are added later.
.PP
Bugs:
When a directory is deleted, it's watches are not removed.
Adding and deleting a lot of sub\-directories rapidly may confuse rerun.
